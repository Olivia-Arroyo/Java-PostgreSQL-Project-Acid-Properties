# Java-PostgreSQL-Project-Acid-Properties
A Java project that implements a query and ensures the ACID properties of Atomicity and Isolation are implemented through the transactions. The task of this project was to implement these ACID properties for a relational database schema that included the tables Product and Stock. The JDBC API was used as the driver to connect to the DBMS. A query was assigned to add a product to the Product Table with the values: (p100, cd, 5) and to add a product to the Stock table with the values: (p100, d2, 50).

Here is a brief video explaining the code and how the ACID properties were implemented:
